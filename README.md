# PrimeStream with React, TypeScript, Express
I developed this as a "semi"-fullstack application. The API endpoints were created using Express and JavaScript in a separate repository hosted on Netlify.
The front end was built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The data persistence is managed with the server.
For simplicity, I chose not to include the login functionality, as it isn't easily deployable in a serverless environment.

The biggest challenge I faced was implementing horizontal scrolling. I had to conduct extensive research to find a solution.
At the end of the day, it was as simple as using a grid with overflow hidden.
